# Cookie Clicker Automation
Credits to [TheCodingSloth](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingSloth) I got the code from his video and published it here so people can copy-paste it

This script automatically clicks for you in Cookie Clicker and checks every 1 second if you can afford any buildings or upgrades. If so it'll buy a random one

## How to use
1. Open [CookieClicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and navigate to 'console'
3. Paste the content of [script.js](https://github.com/construktdev/CookieClickerCheat/blob/master/script.js) in the console and hit enter

### Stopping
Go back into the console and type 'stopAutomation'

### Future Updates
In future Updates i will add that the script also collects the Golden Cookies just like in the video
